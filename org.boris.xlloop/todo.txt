- add list of servers to connect to (either round robin or random selection)
- probably use list like (servers=localhost:5600,myserver,myserver:8000)
- also allow a server to indicate another server to use each time
  a new connection is created (ie. when no connection exists)
- client/server talk in xlopers
- separate out scripting example/provider to separate jar to remove excess 
  dependencies
- tray icon for stopping xllop/resetting connection?
- popup for long running functions?
