
- need to make popup a dialog that isn't toplevel or on top of everything - just modal to the
  excel window
  
- support for multiple servers

	server.1.hostname=localhost
	server.1.port=80
	server.1.function=FS
	server.1.function.volatile=FSV
	server.2.protocol=http
	server.2.url=http://xlloop.appspot.com/functionserver
	server.2.function=GFS
	server.2.function.help=Generic function executor for Google deployment


- jquantlib wrapper

- store data facility:
	XG.Save(tag, password, [data])
	XG.Load(tag)
	
	website can query for data based on a tag
	no password assumes public data, which is visible, writeable by anyone
	
- store hits on each bit of data so web front end can show popular data
- data with no password only lasts for x days/hours
- data with password lasts much longer (need to think about how long)
	- run cron jobs to clear out old data

- limit on IP address to X (eg. 20) saves per hour	

	
- maybe also have optional read password as well for private data
- google finance api
- bank of england
- us data gov


- provide access to google spreadsheets

* need a way to authenticate to google...

- INI option to switch off generic functions (FS, FSV)


- fix proxy support with auto config url (proxy.pac)
- to real method overload support using defined overload resolution from java language spec
- 

- server will contain a collection of functions (written in?)
	 - users can subscribe to channels of function
	 - they will create their own personalized function server with their selection of functions
	 	- http://xlloop.appspot.com/functionserver/user1
	 - need a way to generate an XLL based on this selection.



scalability
===========

- add list of servers to connect to (either round robin or random selection)
- probably use list like (servers=localhost:5600,myserver,myserver:8000)
- create a proxy server that can multiplex requests out to child servers.

reliability
===========

- separate out scripting example/provider to separate jar to remove excess 
  dependencies

building/configuration
======================

- a version with 30 args (or build in support for say 10 functions that have
  more than 10 args)

protocols
=========

- http protocol version - ie. xmlcodec over http so php users can support this 
  natively
- add a way to add urls to the client (ini file is not user-friendly), maybe
  a registry based bookmark list
- date handling, maybe add support for exceldate object on object converter.
  
server/language support
=======================  

- haskell server?
 
addin support
=============

- add excel 2007 support
- open office calc extension?

xlloop-http
===========

INI file

server.1=http://yahoo.com/FunctionServer
server.1.FunctionName=Yahoo
server.2=http://xlloop.com/CommonServer
server.2.FunctionName=XLLoop


server.1.FunctionName creates a function "Yahoo", which takes the normal "FS" arguments.

normal FSW (web) function take FSW(url, name, args...)
or XLLoop(...)
XLLoopV(..)
