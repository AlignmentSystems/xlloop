
scalability
===========
- add list of servers to connect to (either round robin or random selection)
- probably use list like (servers=localhost:5600,myserver,myserver:8000)

reliability
===========
- also allow a server to indicate another server to use each time
  a new connection is created (ie. when no connection exists)
- client/server talk in xlopers
- separate out scripting example/provider to separate jar to remove excess 
  dependencies
- tray icon for stopping xllop/resetting connection?
- popup for long running functions?

building/configuration
======================
- a smaller version with wcrt.lib instead of msvcrt
- a version with 30 args (or build in support for say 10 functions that have
  more than 10 args)
- a build with support for 1000 functions

protocols
=========
- http protocol version - ie. xmlcodec over http so php users can support this 
  natively
- add a way to add urls to the client (ini file is not user-friendly), maybe
  a registry based bookmark list
- date handling, maybe add support for exceldate object on object converter.
  
server/language support
=======================  
- fix erlang server
- create r server
- create ruby server
- create python server
 
addin support
=============
- open office calc extension?
